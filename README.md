## RPM Method

The Python implementation of the **RPM (real part maximization)** method proposed in the paper *"Online Sampling Rate Offset Estimation via Real Part Maximization"* can be found in the file `RPM_PythonVer`. 

Some comments have been added to help align the code with the corresponding equations in the paper.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at ðŸ“§ [gshanzheng@foxmail.com](mailto:gshanzheng@foxmail.com).

You're also welcome to explore, use, or improve the code as part of this open-source project!

## Data Generation

- **Diffuse Babble Noise Generation**  
  The generation of diffuse babble noise follows the method described in [1].  
  The corresponding implementation and source files can be found in the `ANF-Generator-BabbleNoise` directory.

- **Data with Sampling Rate Offset (SRO)**  
  We extended the dataset released in [2] to enrich the acoustic scenarios and cover more diverse and realistic conditions.  
  This extension was built upon their open-source implementation, available at:  
  [https://github.com/fgnt/paderwasn/tree/main/paderwasn/databases](https://github.com/fgnt/paderwasn/tree/main/paderwasn/databases)

  To support the extended setup, we made several modifications to the original data generation pipeline.  
  These changes are implemented in the `SomeMod_DataGen` module, specifically in the following files:  
  - `create_json.py`  
  - `write_files.py`  
  - `audio_generation.py`

  In addition, all configuration files related to data generation â€” including both initial settings and intermediate outputs â€” are organized under the `SomeMod_DataGen/db_json_sv` directory.
